// MARK: - Issue #453 — the classifier's decision must survive to the click
//
// `ModalReconciliation.classify` treats a top-level `AXDialog` as safe to
// acknowledge only when it carries EXACTLY ONE titled button; two or more means
// a choice, and choices are never auto-answered.
//
// That decision used not to reach the click. The executor re-resolved `first
// window whose subrole is "AXDialog"` in AppleScript, so a dialog that arrived
// between classification and click was clicked though it was never classified,
// and a failed title lookup fell through to `click button 1` with no count check
// at all — on that path the safety discriminator did not participate.
//
// The fix binds the click to the classified ELEMENT and re-checks the count from
// that element immediately before pressing. These tests drive the real
// `reconcilePreflight` entry point against a fake AX tree, and the AX tree is
// allowed to CHANGE between the classify read and the click read — which is the
// only way to exercise the window the old code left open.
//
// Both directions are locked. A gate that never acknowledges would be as wrong
// as one that always does: a genuine single-button alert would then block the
// server forever, so the success path is asserted too, along with WHICH element
// was pressed.

/// A value that changes between AX reads, switched at a CALIBRATED boundary.
///
/// The point of these tests is the gap between the classify read and the click
/// read, so the fixture has to flip state exactly once, after classification and
/// before the executor looks. How many AX reads classification performs is an
/// implementation detail — `mainWindow`, the dialog filter and the button scan
/// each read — so hard-coding "switch after the first read" encodes a guess that
/// silently rots the moment a read is added or removed, and a stale guess makes
/// the test pass for the wrong reason.
///
/// Instead the fixture runs a calibration pass first, counts the reads
/// classification actually performs, and switches immediately after that count.
