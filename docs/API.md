# API Reference

Current surface: Logic Pro MCP exposes 10 tools, 18 static resources, and 12 resource templates. The published stable release is v3.13.0, which adds coordinate-free plugin-insert leaf selection (#425) and audit-resource blocking-modal parity (#437) on top of v3.12.0's generated read-only operation catalog (`logic://system/operations`) as the 12th template, the coordinate-free actuation campaign, consent-gated record-arm auto-setup (`system.setup_arm_key`), ADR-002/003/004/005 kernel behavior on by default, and the Homebrew bounce/export packaging fix (#427). It keeps the v3.9.0 MCP capability additions (resource subscriptions, workflow prompts, and per-tool `outputSchema` / `structuredContent`), the v3.9.2 verified plugin closed-window fix, v3.10.0 desktop/Creator Studio targeting, and the v3.11.0 Doctor, tempo, Bounce, region, marker, native toggle, and help-category fixes. `logic_midi` send-only successes and `logic_tracks.arm_only` return Honest Contract JSON envelopes (BREAKING response shape — see CHANGELOG).

Use tools for actions. Use resources for state. Treat every mutating result as one of:

- State A: confirmed success. The server wrote to Logic and independently read the result back.
- State B: uncertain success. The server attempted the action but could not verify the result.
- State C: hard failure. The action did not land and is safe to retry only when `retry_safe` says so.

## MCP Capabilities

`initialize` advertises `resources.subscribe: true`, `resources.listChanged: false`, `prompts.listChanged: false`, and `tools.listChanged: false`.

Resource subscriptions are session-scoped. `resources/subscribe` and `resources/unsubscribe` accept any listed resource URI or concrete resource-template URI. When a subscribed state resource changes, the server sends `notifications/resources/updated` with the changed `uri`. Change detection hashes the stable `data` payload of cache-envelope resources, or the whole payload for non-envelope resources, after recursively excluding volatile keys: `generated_at`, `fetched_at`, `cache_age_sec`, and `mcu_last_feedback_age_ms`.

`prompts/list` and `prompts/get` expose the workflow skill catalog as prompt templates. Prompt definitions are derived from `WorkflowSkillCatalog`, the same source used by `logic://workflow-skills`.

Every tool in `tools/list` advertises an `outputSchema`. Mixed command tools advertise the Honest Contract envelope for mutating commands: mutating commands return the Honest Contract envelope (`success`/`verified`/`state`, additional operation-specific keys); read-only commands return command-specific JSON objects. Honest Contract properties are non-required so read-only responses validate against the mixed-tool schema. Read-only/read-ish tools advertise a generic JSON object. For `tools/call`, when the text response is already a JSON object, the same object is also attached as `structuredContent`; the text payload is unchanged for backward compatibility.

## Resource Templates

`logic://system/operations` (exact read-only catalog URI), `logic://tracks/{index}`, `logic://tracks/{index}/regions`, `logic://mixer/{strip}`,
`logic://stock-plugins/{id}`, `logic://stock-plugins/search?query={query}`,
`logic://stock-instruments/{id}`, `logic://stock-instruments/search?query={query}`,
`logic://session-players/{id}`, `logic://workflow-plans/session?prompt={prompt}`,
`logic://workflow-skills/{id}`, `logic://workflow-skills/search?query={query}`.

Registered operations reject unknown command-parameter keys at the runtime boundary by default, before cache access, mutation gates, or dispatcher invocation. The State C `invalid_params` response includes sorted `unknown_params` and `allowed_params`. Selector keys are operation-scoped: `target_ref` is recognized only when the operation's target policy is `accepts_stable_target`, while `index` and `track` appear only on operations whose dispatcher consumes those aliases. `expected_name` is recognized only on the `corroborated` index-binding tier (see [Index binding](#index-binding)). The exact per-operation set is published by `logic://system/operations`; `record_sequence` also preserves its ignored `instrument` / `instrument_path` inputs. Set `LOGIC_MCP_ADR003_STRICT_PARAMS=0` only as a temporary compatibility escape hatch for registered-command parameter pass-through; it does not expose unregistered commands or dispatcher-only aliases.

### Index binding

A track index is an **ordinal, not an identity**. Between the moment you read `logic://tracks` and the moment your write lands, a drag, a track creation, or a folder collapse can shift every row — and an index-keyed write then lands on a track you never named. `target_ref` (ADR-002) solves this by binding to a session-stable identity. It is accepted **by default** — set `LOGIC_MCP_ADR002_TARGET_REF=0` to disable the machinery, after which any supplied `target_ref` fails closed with `target_ref_unavailable`. But the server being willing to accept a `target_ref` does not make callers send one: the bare-index path stays open, so the registry declares what each operation demands of a **bare index** on a second, orthogonal axis: `index_binding`, published per-operation by `logic://system/operations`.

The field is present only on operations that are both target-bearing (`target` = `accepts_stable_target`) and mutating — the only ones with an index path that can hit a wrong target. Read-only and non-target operations omit it entirely rather than publishing a null.

| Tier | Meaning | Today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ref_required` | A bare index is refused; only `target_ref` binds. | **No operations.** Implemented and tested; the first promotion is a registry row flip and will appear as a catalog diff. |
| `corroborated` | A bare index must be corroborated by `expected_name`. | `tracks.delete`, `tracks.duplicate`, `tracks.set_instrument`, `plugins.insert_verified` |
| `legacy_index_allowed` | The historical unguarded index path. | **Deprecated** — see below. |

#### The corroboration contract

For a `corroborated` operation called **without** `target_ref`, supply `expected_name`: the track name you believe sits at the index. (It is not spelled `name` because several of these operations already spend `name` on an operand — `tracks.rename`'s new name, `tracks.select`'s by-name selector.) The server then reads the **live** track header before writing — never the state cache, which lags an out-of-band reorder by the poll interval and would therefore agree with exactly the stale view being defended against.

Every failure below is fail-closed and **pre-write**: `write_attempted: false` is a fact, not a claim — the operation returns before anything is routed.

| Condition | State C error | `safe_to_retry` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No `expected_name` and no `target_ref` | `index_binding_corroboration_required` | `true` — supply either binding |
| Live name at the index ≠ `expected_name` | `target_identity_mismatch` (`reason: name_mismatch`) | `false` — re-read `logic://tracks` first |
| Live header unreadable | `target_identity_mismatch` (`reason: header_unreadable`) | `false` — an unreadable surface is never read as agreement |
| `expected_name` matches but names >1 live track | `ambiguous_target_name` (`ambiguous_track_indices` lists all colliding indices) | `false` — use `target_ref` |
| `expected_name` **and** `target_ref` both supplied | `invalid_params` | `true` — send exactly one binding |

Uniqueness is not a nicety. Two tracks sharing a name can swap positions and leave `(index, name)` self-consistent at **both** ordinals, so a match would prove nothing; `target_ref` is the only binding a swap cannot fool. Supplying `target_ref` bypasses this path entirely — the reference machinery carries its own live-identity and ambiguity checks, and the two are never stacked.

**Corroboration is a pre-write proof, not atomic with the write.** It reads the live header, then writes; a reorder that lands in that narrow guard-to-write interval can still put the write on the wrong track. Corroboration *narrows* the wrong-target window (from "any time since your last read" down to "the guard-to-write interval"); it does not eliminate it. Only `target_ref` — and the future `ref_required` tier — bind an identity that holds across the write and close the window entirely. Prefer `target_ref` when wrong-target cost is high.

`expected_name` is a binding proof, not a write parameter: it is never forwarded to the channel, and a matching, unique corroboration leaves the existing index write path completely unchanged.

#### Deprecation: `legacy_index_allowed`

This tier is the pre-ratchet behaviour and is **deprecated**. Its members still write to a bare, unproven ordinal; each remains only because a wrong-target write there is *recoverable* (`mixer.set_volume`, `mixer.set_pan`, `plugins.set_param_verified`, `tracks.select`, `tracks.rename`, `tracks.mute`, `tracks.solo`, `tracks.arm`, `tracks.arm_only`, `tracks.set_automation`). The set is pinned by census and may only shrink. Prefer `target_ref` on these operations today; do not build on the assumption that a bare index will keep being accepted.

A gap is tracked rather than papered over: two mutating operations key on a track strip yet carry target policy `none` — **`mixer.insert_plugin`** (irreversible insert) and **`mixer.set_plugin_param`** (reversible param write). Because they accept no `target_ref`, the corroboration refusal could not honestly offer one as an alternative, so neither carries a tier. Ratcheting either requires first making it target-bearing (`insert_plugin` would then become `corroborated`; `set_plugin_param`, being reversible, `legacy_index_allowed`).

This exact set is pinned by census — it may only shrink, and any new operation added to the class fails CI until an explicit decision is made. The census discriminator is: **mutating**, target policy **`none`**, and carrying a track-strip selector (`track` or `track_index`). The bare `index` alias is deliberately *not* part of the discriminator: the operations that take `index` without a track-strip selector are the marker operations (`navigate.goto_marker`, `navigate.delete_marker`, `navigate.rename_marker`), whose `index` addresses a marker, not a track — a different wrong-target class that ADR-002 index binding does not cover.

### Track state values (`logic://tracks`)

Since v3.8.0, `logic://tracks` reports each track's `volume`, `pan`, and `automationMode` as REAL values read from the live track header (the same AX fader the mixer write path drives). These three were previously fabricated (`0.0` / `0.0` / `off`) by the production builder. The correction is **value-only** — the `TrackState` keys and types are unchanged (no new field, sentinel, or nullable), so existing parsers are unaffected. On a rare AX-read failure a field falls back to its former default, and the envelope's `source` / `ax_occluded` fields already flag degraded reads.

Track objects do **not** carry a sample rate. Sample rate is a project/transport-level value exposed on `logic://project/info`, which still falls back to a fabricated `44100` default when a live transport sample-rate is unavailable (documented limitation).

## Command Notes

### `logic_transport`

| Command | Params | Result | Route |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| `play`, `record` | none | text / contract envelope | Accessibility -> MCU -> CoreMIDI -> CGEvent -> AppleScript |
| `stop` | none | text / contract envelope | CGEvent -> Accessibility -> MCU -> CoreMIDI -> AppleScript |
| `pause`, `rewind`, `fast_forward` | none | text / contract envelope | routed transport fallback chain |
| `toggle_cycle` | — | text | Accessibility → MIDIKeyCommands → CGEvent → MCU |
| `toggle_count_in` | — | text / contract envelope | routed transport fallback chain |
| `toggle_autopunch` | — | State A/B/C contract envelope | Accessibility |
| `set_cycle_range` | `{ start, end }` | fails closed: current Logic builds expose no verifiable numeric cycle-locator automation path, so it returns State C (`not_implemented` / `readback_unavailable`) rather than claim an unverified success | Accessibility (attempted) |
| `set_tempo` | `{ tempo: number }` (5–999, matches Logic's actual accepted range) | text | Accessibility |
| `goto_position` | `{ bar: number }` or `{ position: string }` | text / contract envelope | Accessibility -> MIDIKeyCommands -> MMC |

Read current state from `logic://transport/state` after any transport mutation.

### `logic_tracks`

Use explicit indices or names. Track mutation fails closed when the target cannot be identified or read back.

Common commands: `select`, `create_audio`, `create_instrument`, `create_drummer`, `create_external_midi`, `delete`, `duplicate`, `rename`, `mute`, `solo`, `arm`, `arm_only`, `record_sequence`, `set_automation`, `set_instrument`, `list_library`, `scan_library`, `resolve_path`, `scan_plugin_presets`.

**`delete`, `duplicate`, and `set_instrument` no longer accept a bare index.** They are `corroborated` (see [Index binding](#index-binding)): pass `expected_name` (the track name you expect at that index) or `target_ref`. Without one, they fail closed with `index_binding_corroboration_required` and write nothing.

`set_automation` is State B (MCU write, no readback echo).

For Library patches, treat `presetsByCategory` as a browse/catalog view. Default `scan_library` uses the local filesystem catalog from the user Logic Library plus Logic Pro's app bundle, dedupes relative `.patch` candidates, and reports `candidatePatchCount` plus `nonApplicablePatchCount` when a file candidate has no Panel-taxonomy route. Before calling `set_instrument`, call `resolve_path` and require `exists: true`, `kind: "leaf"`, and `loadable: true`. Folder/category rows return `loadable: false` and `set_instrument` fails closed with `folder_not_preset` instead of treating a selected row as a loaded patch.

`record_sequence` writes a server-generated MIDI file under a private server-managed temp directory, imports it into Logic, and verifies the created region. If the import returns an unverified State B result, including GM Device / External MIDI lanes that can bounce silent, `record_sequence` fails closed with `audibility_unverified` or `import_unverified` instead of promoting region readback to audible success.

### `logic_mixer`

Public commands: `set_volume`, `set_pan`, `set_master_volume`, `set_plugin_param`, `insert_plugin`.

`set_volume` and `set_pan` use Accessibility write/readback against the visible strip. `set_master_volume` writes through MCU and verifies with a fresh MCU echo or independent Control Bar AX readback. `set_output`, `set_input`, `set_send`, `toggle_eq`, `reset_strip`, and `bypass_plugin` are recognized only to return State C `command_not_exposed` until their targets are deterministic.

Read `logic://mixer` before and after mixer mutations.

### `logic_plugins`

This is the verified apply-back surface.

Flow:

1. `get_inventory` reads the target track's plugin insert slots.
2. `insert_verified` inserts an allowlisted stock plugin into an explicit physical slot and verifies post-write inventory.
3. `logic_plugins.set_param_verified` writes a supported parameter and verifies readback.

Important constraints:

- `insert_verified` requires a confirmation gate named `duplicate_applyback` when the operation can mutate an existing session.
- `set_param_verified` currently verifies Compressor `threshold` only, normalized 0..100, tolerance 1.0.
- `set_param_verified` can open the target insert's plugin editor when it is closed, but it writes only after the requested AX slider is present in the acquired window.
- Arbitrary plugin parameters fail closed with `unsupported_param_readback`.
- The legacy Scripter `set_plugin_param` path is a legacy unverified State B path. Use `logic_plugins.set_param_verified` for verified apply-back.

Minimal `set_param_verified` shape:

```json
{
  "command": "set_param_verified",
  "track": 5,
  "insert": 6,
  "plugin": "logic.stock.effect.compressor",
  "param": "threshold",
  "value": 60,
  "unit": "normalized",
  "mode": "duplicate_applyback",
  "project_expected_path": "/path/to/project.logicx"
}
```

### `logic_midi`

Common commands: `send_note`, `send_chord`, `send_cc`, `send_program_change`, `send_pitch_bend`, `send_aftertouch`, `send_sysex`, `play_sequence`, `import_file`, `list_ports`, `create_virtual_port`, `step_input`, `mmc_play`, `mmc_stop`, `mmc_record`, `mmc_locate`.

Channels are 1-based (`1..16`) to match Logic's UI.

`send_sysex` accepts `{ bytes: [Int] }` or `{ data: "F0 ... F7" }` and rejects payloads over 1024 bytes before routing to CoreMIDI.

Send-only success responses return an Honest Contract State B JSON envelope because CoreMIDI/MMC writes have no deterministic readback:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "verified": false,
  "state": "B",
  "reason": "send_only_no_readback",
  "operation": "midi.send_note",
  "legacy_message": "Note 60 on ch 0 vel 100 dur 30ms",
  "note": 60,
  "velocity": 100,
  "channel_wire": 0,
  "duration_ms": 30,
  "message_count": 2
}
```

`mmc_locate` with a `bar` parameter is the exception: it routes through `transport.goto_position` and keeps the transport readback contract. Time-based `mmc_locate` remains send-only State B.

`create_virtual_port` reuses same-name/same-mode ports. Reusing a name across modes fails closed with State C `port_unavailable` and includes `port_name`, `existing_mode`, and `requested_mode`.

No MIDI read-back command is shipped in v3.12.0: `read_selection_notes` and `record_sequence verify_notes` remain deferred.

### `logic_edit`

Common commands: `undo`, `redo`, `cut`, `copy`, `paste`, `delete`, `select_all`, `split`, `join`, `quantize`, `bounce_in_place`, `normalize`, `duplicate`, `toggle_step_input`.

`quantize` requires `{ value: String }` or `{ grid: String }` and accepts the dispatcher grids `1/1`, `1/2`, `1/4`, `1/8`, `1/16`, `1/32`, `1/64`, `1/4T`, `1/8T`, and `1/16T`.

### `logic_navigate`

Common commands: `goto_bar`, `goto_marker`, `create_marker`, `delete_marker`, `rename_marker`, `zoom_to_fit`, `set_zoom`, `toggle_view`.

`delete_marker` and indexed `goto_marker` require explicit indices. `rename_marker` is not implemented on Logic 12.x and returns State C `not_implemented`. `set_zoom` accepts `in`, `out`, `fit`, or integer levels `1..10` and uses the writable Accessibility zoom slider when present.

### `logic_project`

Common commands: `new`, `open`, `save`, `save_as`, `close`, `bounce`, `is_running`, `launch`, `quit`, `get_regions`, `export_plan`, `export_run`, `export_resume`, `audit`, `cleanup_plan`, `cleanup_apply`.

Destructive or file-writing paths require confirmation. `save_as` verifies the resulting `.logicx` package. `audit` marks GM Device / External MIDI tracks with MIDI regions as `external_midi_regions_bounce_risk` export blockers. `bounce` runs that preflight, then opens and verifies Logic's native File > Bounce dialog; the caller completes the settings and destination in Logic. It returns `export_readiness_blocked` before opening the dialog when blockers are present. `export_plan` is read-only; `export_run` and `export_resume` re-plan, open, verify project identity, bounce, and verify artifacts via `logic_audio`.

`get_regions` returns `{ regions, complete, scope, reason, returned_count, _debug }`. Logic's AX tree currently exposes the visible arrange viewport only, so the response reports `complete:false`, `scope:"visible_arrange_area"`, and `reason:"logic_ax_viewport_only"`; callers must not treat `regions` as a project-wide inventory. Project audit preserves that limitation as `ax_visible_subset`, emits `region_inventory_partial`, and withholds empty-track claims for unseen lanes.

### `logic_audio`

`analyze_file` inspects an existing audio artifact and reports duration, level, silence ratio, and verification status. It does not mutate Logic.

### `logic_system`

Common commands: `health`, `permissions`, `refresh_cache`, `export_support_bundle`, `setup_arm_key`, `list_recent_traces`, `get_trace`, `clear_traces`, `saga_preflight`, `saga_execute`, `saga_status`, `saga_cancel`, `help`.

Use `health` for channel readiness and `help` for command summaries. `help` accepts category `all`, `transport`, `tracks`, `mixer`, `midi`, `edit`, `navigate`, `project`, `audio`, `plugins`, or `system`.

#### `setup_arm_key` (v3.12.0)

Consent-gated auto-setup for Logic's "Toggle Track Record Enable" key command — the coordinate-free arm actuator's prerequisite. Without `consent: true` it returns State C `consent_required` before any parameter validation or mutation (consent-first). With consent it runs verify-first: it drives a real record-arm flip **and restore** using only the configured chord, so an already-working mapping short-circuits to State A (`write_source: "existing_mapping_verify"`) with zero GUI mutation; otherwise it performs the assignment in Logic's Key Commands window and functionally re-verifies the new mapping the same way. Every outcome is an Honest Contract envelope: State A only after an observed flip AND restore; a chord already owned by another command fails closed as `chord_conflict` and is never stolen; an environment with no selectable track fails closed as `verify_environment_unavailable` with no GUI mutation attempted. Evidence fields include `configuration_write_attempted`, `verification_mutation_attempted`, `restored`, `safe_to_retry`, and (GUI path) window/search/selection/learn readbacks. Set `LOGIC_PRO_MCP_ARM_KEYCODE` / `LOGIC_PRO_MCP_ARM_MODIFIERS` to choose a non-default chord.

Operation tracing is on by default (set `LOGIC_MCP_ADR005_OPERATION_TRACE=0` to disable), so every **successful** mutating result (State A/B) carries a `trace_id`; State C failures do not (nothing was traced to completion). `list_recent_traces` returns bounded summaries from the in-process trace store and accepts optional `limit`.
`get_trace` returns one stored trace by required `trace_id`.
`clear_traces` clears only the in-process trace store and requires `confirmed:true` because it destroys in-session diagnostic evidence.

#### Measuring the AppleScript segment (v3.13+)

`midi.import_file` runs under three nested time budgets: the operation deadline, the bound on its `osascript` call, and the Swift-side AX polling around it. Only the outermost one used to cross the process boundary, so the middle budget — the one that produced the `midi.import_file` timeout reported in #449 — could be reasoned about but not measured. Summing the script's own `delay` statements is not a substitute: those sums omit every AX query and file operation between the delays, so they cannot establish real headroom.

Traces for that operation now carry a `script_segment.completed` event with an `applescript_duration_ms` attribute: the measured elapsed time of the `osascript` call, taken with a monotonic clock so an NTP correction cannot invent or erase it. Compare it against the bound in `ServerConfig.midiImportAppleScriptTimeout` to read actual headroom on a given machine and project.

The attribute is diagnostic only. Nothing gates on it, it is never a verification signal, and it carries no user content — only an elapsed count of milliseconds.

`saga_preflight` and `saga_execute` accept `{ steps: [step], idempotency_key: String }`; each step contains `operation_id`, optional `target_ref`, `params`, and `expected_inverse`. Preflight performs no Logic writes and reports per-step before-state availability. Execute reports verified per-step evidence; a failed request remains State C even when every applied step is compensated, while partial or unknown compensation is State B.

The bounded journal belongs only to the current server session and is cleared on session end or process restart. A completed duplicate key returns its stored outcome with `duplicate:true`; `saga_status` reads that record. `saga_cancel` returns a typed refusal for active work because the current engine has no safe cancellation seam. Ordered work with compensation does not promise all-or-nothing completion or durable recovery.

The journal keeps two independently bounded tiers, so pressure costs stored evidence rather than safety:

- **Replay protection (whole session).** Every `idempotency_key` begun in a session stays recorded for that whole session. A key that reached a terminal state never starts again — replay protection does not lapse, expire, or time out. There is no wall-clock TTL.
- **Outcome bodies (most recent N).** Full stored outcomes are retained for the most recent `journal_record_capacity` sagas (default 1024). Under insertion pressure the oldest terminal body is dropped; in-flight sagas are never dropped.

Retrying an older completed saga whose body was dropped returns `saga_outcome_unavailable` (State C, terminal) instead of the original body — never a re-execution. It carries `terminal_kind` (`completed` or `cancelled`), `outcome_retained:false`, `safe_to_retry:false`, and `write_attempted:false`. `terminal_kind` names only which path the saga terminated on; it is **not** a claim that the intent succeeded (a `completed` saga may have applied only partially). Reconcile by observing current state via `saga_status` or the relevant read operations — do not re-fire the same intent blindly. `saga_status` for such a key still reports its terminal `status` with `outcome_retained:false` and no `outcome`.

`saga_journal_capacity_exceeded` remains distinct and unchanged in meaning: the journal cannot admit a **new** key. It is returned under either of two conditions — the session's replay-protection tier (`journal_compact_capacity`, default 65536) is full, or the outcome tier is fully occupied by in-flight sagas and therefore holds no terminal body that can be reclaimed. Both stay fail-closed: admitting a key the session cannot replay-protect, or evicting a saga still running, would be a correctness hole rather than an availability one.

`saga_status` and `saga_preflight` publish `journal_full_body_count`, `journal_compact_count`, `journal_body_evictions`, `journal_compact_capacity`, and `journal_record_capacity` for operators. These are diagnostics only — none of them promises that a later retry will fit, and `journal_survives_process_restart` stays `false`.

### Not-exposed commands

A few command tokens are recognised by the dispatchers but are deliberately **not part of the production MCP contract** (no deterministic / verified path exists yet). They are excluded from the workflow command census and return a single machine-classifiable State C shape — `error: "command_not_exposed"`, `not_exposed: true`, `supported: false`, plus the `operation` — so a complete-surface demo/test harness can classify them as *expected*, not a malfunction:

- `logic_tracks.set_color`
- `logic_mixer.set_send`, `logic_mixer.set_output`, `logic_mixer.set_input`, `logic_mixer.toggle_eq`, `logic_mixer.reset_strip`, `logic_mixer.bypass_plugin`

## Error Format

State C errors use stable machine-readable strings such as `invalid_params`, `not_implemented`, `command_not_exposed`, `index_out_of_range`, `element_not_found`, `readback_mismatch`, `port_unavailable`, `channels_exhausted`, `unsupported_param_readback`, and `confirmation_required`.

Clients should branch on `state`, `verified`, `error`, and `retry_safe`; do not parse human prose as the contract.
